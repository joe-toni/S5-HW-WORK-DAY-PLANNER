# S5-HW-WORK-DAY-PLANNER
##### Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
For this assignment we were tasked with completing the work day planner starter code we were given. We were supposed to use both moment.js and jquery to demontstrate our ability to use third party apis in our code. We used moment to get information that we would use to color code portions of the program. We also used jquery to facilitate the selection of HTML elements as well as the manipulation of associated classes. We also persisted data entered by the user using a similar method from the Section 3 homework working with both locally created variables and objects created and saved onto localStorage.
